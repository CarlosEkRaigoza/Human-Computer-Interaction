# Human-Computer-Interaction

# UsabilityvsUX: 

The relationship between those concepts is reduced to coherence itself, adding that the set of those results on a solid, intuitive and attractive interface.  

But starting from the base, the human computer interaction looks to create an intuitive digital system for a group of users, the UX is how the user feels or perceive the developed environment (For example, confirmation messages and notifications that gives feedback to the user), in other words, the grade of satisfaction with the given experience.  

And finally, the usability works over how the user receives the developed product by himself and over the feelings obtained in UX, in other words, how intuitive it felt by the user, the interface state and the user freedom to use it, how intuitive is to do an activity, etc.  

An specific difference between Usability and UX is that usability focus in how easy and efficient is to use a system, while UX includes emotional and user’s peception aspects at interacting with the system, and starting from that, this concept can be seen in the psychology clinic system, from which the usability is showed by an easy to understand series of buttons with them having written their purpose (for example a buttons that says “save / modify document”), and the UX would be to watch some confirm signal (that following the last example, notify through displaying a message saying that modifications have been saved correctly).  

In my case, the example that can be implemented would be like the “writing date” function described before, but it is more related to the revision of the documents made by the psychologist's supervisors (generally students which have an assigned supervisor that realizes the revision of their documents in order to evaluate their performance), in which after the phycologist in charge realize modifications to the document, this receive a notification saying that their notes and modifications have been revised by their supervisor, and if he has approved it’s modifications; this element could be measurable in relation with estimated time in order to give the received confirmation by the supervisors, and those modification’s acceptance range (this also would help to detect improvement points, especially if there are multiple rejects in the modifications of the documents).
