# Personas: 

In development and requirements elicitation scope and with order of the professor, we needed to do a persona development but simplifying it due to lack of information and time.  

But entering deep in the subject; we focused on the use of personas form the needs and goals area, which generally came highly related between, and it truly helped us to determine development problems, frustrations and moral and physic restrictions. It was very important because it changed the whole initial idea we had about the project, giving us an important reality smash to land our ideas and take a new course to the solutions that was planned basing in limitations and restrictions that was pictured to the users. 

In our case we had the chance to talk to some workers (students in services and practices) about the clinic situation for recollecting personas and through some questions previously made, go asking for information relevant to us and through talking with them have a more informal view about the user needs which we could use to do the software, which helped us to have a bit more information plus to the restrictions and points of view of this users. 

Even if this raw information (going with it was a little puzzle to check one by one each member notes to then summarize them), summarizing it and then with a review, it was easier to understand the general opinions about the clinic needs, and adding the element of a meet record, and in review to obtain each user points of view, it helped us to do a better persona definition more informed where we showed the needs that each user describe, relevant considerations they consider and their goals. 

Even if the project is still in a very initial point and there is too much to do to well define what is going to be made, I'd highlight as a use example of documentâ€™s digitalization which added with the clinic persona who mention that the technology of the processes is very old, it is viable the digitalization of the documents as a form of processes update and documentation of the clinic.
