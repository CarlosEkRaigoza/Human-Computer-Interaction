To do this reflection I'm taking as example the semi structured interviews tecnic. 

This tecnic is centered in the information obtention through structured questions for obtaining the necessary and important information for the project development, and the requirements definition. Generally, in this process the questions are defined, priorate by the information importance that is wanted to obtain, and the obtained information is analyzed. 

Talking about our team, it was truly similar the interview preparation process, the questions prioritization according to what we considered that was most relevant to our purpose, and defining who was needed to ask and that the others should bring note to the interview and extra information that we considered relevant, next we had to make a table with the obtained information by each one to complement and make a set of more complete notes about the interview.  

At the end of the whole process, I could notice it was a better way to manage the activities, like time management which we hadn’t the best control of, which result in a meeting delay and the fact that we couldn’t ask all the questions we prepared. Another point and the most relevant is the information table in which due to having been made of too much notes we had problems to make a good recollection for the requirements definition and in some cases the information was poor and there was points where one member considered relevant, but others don’t, which was motive of analysis in order to determine if it was truly relevant. 

The general process have various improvement points, like the questions definition, how to prioritize the questions (even if this goes more with the interviewer's opinion), the making of the information table, or how it was going to be recollected the questions information, and for me the most important, the time management. Especially in this case it is necessary to practice how to improve this time, due to that I consider that the delay of those can be problematic in cases where the available time could be shorter, so because of this we should work in where to point the questions and take away questions that could create a delay. Thought talking about the questions that may create a delay, maybe those could bring out important information, so my personal consideration is if the problem in the interviews is the lack of time or a lack of focus to the relevant information to the user context where we work.
