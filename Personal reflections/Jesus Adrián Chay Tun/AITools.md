The production-quality relationship depends entirely in the context and quality of the programmer because we start with the point that there is a lot of considerations before implementing AI in development, so it is also important realizing if the person using it use it as a tool or to make absolutely everything, because there would be cases where AI will do everything solicited, but it will not be correct necessarily, it can do an interface with everything required, but does it do it in the correct form?; we start not knowing if the person using AI actually know what he is doing, which will determine the quality that the AI could bring us, the programmer can be based and have help of the tool but solving fails, failures identifying improvement points adapting what AI can bring to the real needs. So in my opinion the quality of a product can be whether very god or very bad depending on the context where the product is developed. 

From my experience it is kind of easy to use, though it also depends in the previous knowledge, i have used it to develop UI (web and apps) and this depends on how much familiar you are with the process, and often even without this knowledge it is possible to carry the development of a UI, and even recently it helped me to make one project with a previously done UI, which i had for web, although it required to be executed without web dependency and an AI (in this case i used grok) helped me in the process to reuse all previously generated code to reuse it in an executable showing me step by step how to convert it through Electron Framework. 

In my perspective, and as the only user of the UI (the UI was for an earth station) it satisfies the needs i have, although it was based on a previously developed base, and I don't know if i can say it has high usability or not. In my context, it's intuitive and easy to use, but I do know the parameters for determining whether it meets certain level of usability. 

Finally, the UX development with AI really help with time improvement, but at the same way, it requires some knowledge about the problem. Ai can produce a lower quality product (in the cases where the developers don't know the basics of the theme), and a time improvement mantaining some kind of level of quality (for the programmers who have experience), but it truly opens the possibility to reduce time and costs of UX development.
