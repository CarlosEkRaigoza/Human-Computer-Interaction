<h2>Assignment 2: Usability vs UX 22/03/2025</h2>
    <p>Based on the previous class, identify if usability and UX are the same, the professor showed us a mapping and a subset of attributes and broadly speaking, UX has more characteristics or things that are measured, however, the two are closely related, with this I make a conclusion, UX encompasses the complete experience of the user when interacting with a product or system, including emotions, perceptions and usability. And Usability is more specific and practical. A key difference is that Usability focuses on the functionality and ease of use of a system to meet specific objectives (completing tasks, filling out forms, log in), while UX includes more subjective aspects such as pleasure, aesthetics or emotional connection with the product. Based on my project of clinical records, the system allows therapists to search for a clinical record by patient name in their system. If the search is fast and the form has clear and well-labeled fields, that reflects good usability: the task is completed efficiently. However, if the interface design is cold, with dull colors and without visual feedback (like a "success" message after finding the record), or even if the internet in the facilities is deficient even though it does not depend on us, the UX could be deficient because the user does not feel satisfaction or confidence when using it, even if it is functional. A customizable summary view would be integrated, where the user can see at a glance the most relevant information about the patient, such as recent diagnoses, allergies, ongoing medications and upcoming appointments. In addition, a color coding system could be included to highlight critical information (for example, severe allergies in red). Efficiency metric: Average time a doctor takes to find key information before and after implementation. Usability metric: Tests with users to evaluate how fast and intuitive it is to access the summary view. Accuracy metric: Reduction of errors or delays in decision making due to dispersed information.
