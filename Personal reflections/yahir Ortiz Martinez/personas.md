<h2>Reflection 4 personas----------- Yahir Ortiz Martinez 24090291</h2>
    <p>Based on the class to define the "personas" that the project is aimed at and also on the provided link (https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/personas). In the clinical records digitalization project, needs are fundamental to understand what therapists require to perform their work efficiently, and the Personas Toolkit suggests collecting specific items such as "critical tasks that the user needs to complete" and "specific problems that they face in their workflow", these allow designing a system that solves real pain points, such as quickly accessing medical histories or updating data without complications. The method to collect these items was to conduct semi-structured interviews with therapists, secretaries and coordinators, asking, concrete example of the impact of Personas on the product would be the development, reducing access time and improving the experience compared to a generic design based only on demographic data, ensuring that the system responds directly to a critical need of the user.
