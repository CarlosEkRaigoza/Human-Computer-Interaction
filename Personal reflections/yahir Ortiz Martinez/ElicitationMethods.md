<h2>Reflection 3. Yahir O ElicitationMethods</h2>
    <p>Based on the article "TECHNIQUES USED FOR REQUIREMENTS GATHERING AND ELICITATION IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING" TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY OF PEREIRA, PEREIRA 2015 In our project of digitalization of clinical records, we used the technique of semi-structured interviews for requirements gathering, focusing on the needs of therapists, secretaries and the intern. Originally, this technique allows obtaining detailed and flexible information by combining open and closed questions, but in our case, the implementation had certain limitations. Although we managed to collect valuable information, the process did not strictly follow the methodology, as the questions were not made with the users before applying them, which led to omitting some key points. As a result, the generated artifact (requirements document) contained useful information, but details on the priority and frequency of certain clinical processes were missing. To improve the technique when obtaining information, we could include pilot tests of the interviews, define more questions. It would also be useful to estimate the data processing time before starting, since the amount of information collected was greater than expected and it took us more time to synthesize it.
