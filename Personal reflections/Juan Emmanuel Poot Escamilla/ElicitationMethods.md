<H1>Elicitation Methods</H1>
<p>One of the techniques that we used and of wich i will write are the group interviews.<br>
It´s a qualitative technique used to colect information about opinions and perseptions forby bringing together several participants in a moderate discussion is promoted the interaction, achieving a more extendes problem vision<br>
Diring the proyect weaplicated the group interview to know the therapists needs as well as the problems and constraints that could have the proyect development <br>
Thanks to this the result artifacts was our Personas that represents to our users, however, for the poorly prepared implementatiom of the technique on our side it's possible that some of our Personas don´t reflect with acuracy the needs and behavior of the users<br>
Personally, i believe that it´s not a bad technique but we can complement with another technique to uncover lefting or wrong information, one of these could be DFD(Data FLow Diagram), as well as carefully preparing interviews by better defining the topics to be covered and the missing information</p><br>
