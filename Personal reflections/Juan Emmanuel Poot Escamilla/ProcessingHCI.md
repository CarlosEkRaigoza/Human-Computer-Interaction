<p>Unlike traditional UX, Lean UX offers a different approach.<br>
- It focuses in speed up the tasks fron the UX design, substracting documentation and promoting the teamwork<br>
- It's divided into 3-4 faces depending on the reference: Hypothesis, Solution, Tests and/or Feedbak<br>

Analyzingour proyect I donÂ´t believe that we have a lean UX organization, we focus largely on documentation, although not in extreme detail. Additionally, while we do have collaboration within our team, we do not enforce 100% rigid communication <br>
The wich I think that we need to change to approach to Lean UX focus First, it's about not focusing so much on requirements but more on assumptions and hypotheses about the problem itself and areas for improvement, like collaboration. It's also about skipping extensive documentation and focusing on delivering valuable solutions. </p><br>
