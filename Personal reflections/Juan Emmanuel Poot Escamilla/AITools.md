<H1>AI Tools</H1>
<p>It´s not sorprise to anyone that AI tools are changing the way to develope interfaces design, i was using Uizard throwing a series of prompts and evaluating the results it gives me</p><br>
<H2>Quality of the interface produced</H2>
<p>The results obtained thanks to this series of prompts are that apparently the generated templates seem to be following the standar design principles, what makes them visually pleasing and help to the easy of use</p><br>
<H2>My experience when i used it</H2>
<p>Particulary i like the idea of commission the workof create the interface to ChatGPT, because it reduce work time and work charge, however i feel that we are sacrificing a part of personalization that ahman designer can add to the proyect</p><br>
<H2>Usability attribute</H2>
<p>The tool fulfill with usability attributes like consistence and simplicity, because it repeat colors and forms patterns between pages or mockups that hepls to the easy of use</p><br>
<H2>Impact on the UX rol</H2>
<p>I think that with the increassing usege of this AI tools those are redifining whath task have to do a UX designer, because these tools can automate rutinaire task that substract time, and now UX designers can focus on create unique experiences, witch for the moment AIs can´t do</p><br>
