    <h1>Elicitation Methods</h1>
    <h2>Considerations of the Elicitation Technique</h2>
    <p>
    In our project, we used <em>interviews with key users</em> as an elicitation technique to identify functional and non-functional requirements. This technique is useful because it allows us to gather information directly from the end users and adapt the software development to their real needs. However, it also has limitations, as interviewees may provide subjective or incomplete information.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Using interviews is good, but it can be difficult to get accurate data since people can give different or biased opinions.</p>
    <h2>Implementation in our team</h2>
    <p>
    For our clinical records system, we conducted interviews with doctors and administrative staff. We asked them about the problems they face when using current systems and what features they think are most important. However, <em>we did not structure the questions in a standardized format</em>, which led to varied responses that were hard to compare.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> If the questions were structured better, it would help us to make comparisons and analyze the data in a more clear way.</p>
    <h2>Results and Improvements</h2>
    <p>
    The results of the elicitation were useful, but we found that <em>some requirements were ambiguous or contradictory</em>. For example, some doctors wanted a very simple interface with few buttons, while others requested more advanced options. To improve, we could complement the interviews with structured questionnaires and observation analysis to get more objective information.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The results were good, but we can improve the process by gathering more data using different techniques to avoid confusion or contradictions.</p>
