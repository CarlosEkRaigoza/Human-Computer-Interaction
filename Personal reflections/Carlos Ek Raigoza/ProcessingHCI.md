    <h3>Relationship between HCI, Usability, and UX</h3>
    <p>
    <em>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</em> is a field that focuses on improving the interaction between humans and computers, ensuring that the interfaces are intuitive and efficient. <em>Usability</em> is a subset of HCI and focuses specifically on how easy and efficient a system is to use. <em>User Experience (UX)</em>, on the other hand, involves the overall perception of the user about the product, including emotional, aesthetic, and accessibility factors.
    </p>
    <p>
    The relationship between these three concepts is crucial in modern software development. A system can be functional and serve its purpose, but not be usable or provide a satisfactory experience. For example, a clinical record system may allow consulting patient data, but if its design is confusing or requires too many steps, its usability will be poor, and the UX will be negative.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The key is integrating HCI, usability, and UX to create systems that not only work but also offer a pleasant and easy experience for the end users.</p>
    <h3>Difference between Usability and UX</h3>
    <p>
    <em>Usability focuses on the ease of use, efficiency, and effectiveness of the system, while UX considers the emotional impact and satisfaction of the user.</em> The main difference is that UX is a more holistic view that covers not only the functionality and usability of the system but also how the user feels when interacting with it.
    </p>
    <p>
    In our clinical record project, a concrete example of this difference is the design of medical forms. From a usability point of view, it's important that the fields are clear, well-organized, and that the information can be entered quickly. However, from the UX perspective, the visual design, using colors that reduce visual fatigue, and the system's ability to auto-complete information, are also important. This makes the experience smoother and less tedious for doctors.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The essential difference between usability and UX is that, while usability optimizes efficiency, UX aims for a global experience that involves emotions and feelings, which is crucial for user satisfaction.</p>
    <h3>UX Feature for the project</h3>
    <p>
    One <em>UX feature we could include</em> in our system is an <em>intelligent notification system</em> that reminds doctors to update incomplete records or review critical information before closing a consultation. Currently, there's no automated mechanism to help doctors remember these details, which could lead to important omissions.
    </p>
    <p>
    This new notification system could improve the user experience by reducing cognitive load and avoiding errors. Also, to check its impact on UX, we could run user tests to measure how long doctors take to complete tasks before and after implementing the notifications.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Implementing an intelligent notification system not only improves usability but also reduces cognitive load, which is crucial for enhancing user experience in high-demand environments like the healthcare sector.</p>
