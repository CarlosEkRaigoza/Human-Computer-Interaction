    <h1>Personas</h1>
    <h2>Selected Toolkit Elements</h2>
    <p>
        We chose the <em>"needs"</em> category because in our project it is essential to understand the functionalities that doctors and administrators require to manage patient records efficiently. Gathering these needs allows us to design a system that truly facilitates usersâ€™ work and not only meets technical requirements.
    </p> 
    <h2>Data Collection and Analysis Method</h2>
    <p>
        Data was collected through <em>interviews, workplace observation</em>, and <em>analysis of existing documentation</em>. Then, common responses were grouped, and detailed user profiles were created to identify patterns in the users' needs.
    </p>
    <h2>Example of Impact on the Product</h2>
    <p>
        One of the key findings was that doctors require <em>a fast and personalized search interface</em>, as they frequently need to consult records of recurring patients. In response to this need, we decided to include <em>advanced filters and keyword search options</em>, allowing quicker access to relevant information and improving the user experience.
    </p>
    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>
        Creating personas and identifying their needs was an eye-opening process. It became clear that the success of our system depends on aligning it closely with the real challenges and daily tasks of the medical staff. The personalized search feature is a good example of how small changes based on user needs can have a significant impact on system efficiency and user satisfaction. In the future, we may further refine these personas and adjust the system based on user feedback.
