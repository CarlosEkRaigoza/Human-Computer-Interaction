    <h2>Quality of AI-Generated UI</h2>
    <p>
        We explored tools like <em>Figma with AI, ChatGPT for UI code generation</em>, and <em>Uizard, a platform that allows you to design user interfaces with artificial intelligence</em>. Even though these tools generate visually appealing interfaces, <em>they require manual adjustments to align with usability and accessibility principles</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A common problem with these tools is that they create generic designs which might not be optimized for specific use cases. Also, they don’t always take into account accessibility principles like color contrast or keyboard navigation.
    </p>   
    <h2>Experience Using the Tool</h2>
    <p>
        The ease of use of these tools is a positive point because they allow for quick prototype generation. However, <em>they do not replace the experience of a UX/UI designer</em>, since manual intervention is still needed to adjust details and improve the user experience.
    </p>    
    <h2>Usability Evaluation of the Generated UI</h2>
    <p>
        We evaluated the interfaces generated with these tools and found that, in general, <em>they lack a clear visual hierarchy and don’t always follow user-centered design principles</em>. To improve the quality of these interfaces, it is recommended to conduct user testing and iterative adjustments.
    </p>  
    <h2>Impact of AI on the Role of UX</h2>
    <p>
        The UX role won’t disappear with AI, but <em>it will evolve to supervising and adjusting AI-generated interfaces</em> instead of designing them completely from scratch. AI can speed up the design process, but a UX specialist is still needed to ensure that interfaces are accessible, efficient, and aligned with the users' needs.
    </p>    
    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>
        From the exploration of AI tools, it's clear that while they offer great speed and efficiency in generating interfaces, they lack the human touch that UX/UI designers bring to the table. The tools might be a starting point, but they require careful evaluation and refinement to ensure that they align with real user needs and are accessible to all. In the future, these tools could play a larger role, but they will always need human oversight to ensure high-quality user experiences.
